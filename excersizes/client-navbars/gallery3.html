                Halloween
        </h1>
            <p>
                Halloween is a celebration observed in many countries on 31 
                October, 
                the eve of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. It 
                is 
                at the beginning of the observance of Halloween. the time in the 
                liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including 
                saints 
                (hallows), martyrs, and all the faithful departed. In popular 
                culture, the day has become a celebration of horror, being 
                associated with the macabre and supernatural.
                One theory holds that many Halloween traditions were influenced 
                by Celtic harvest festivals, particularly the Gaelic festival 
                Samhain, which are believed to have pagan roots. Some go further 
                and suggest that Samhain may have been Christianized as All 
                Hallow's Day, along with its eve, by the early Church. Other 
                academics believe Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday, 
                being the vigil of All Hallow's Day. Celebrated in Ireland and 
                Scotland for centuries, Irish and Scottish immigrants took many 
                Halloween customs to North America in the 19th century, and then 
                through American influence various Halloween customs spread to 
                other
                countries by the late 20th and early 21st century.
                Popular Halloween activities include trick-or-treating (or the 
                related guising and souling), attending Halloween costume 
                parties, 
                carving pumpkins or turnips into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting 
                bonfires, apple bobbing, divination games, playing pranks, 
                visiting haunted attractions, telling scary stories, and 
                watching 
                horror or Halloween-themed films.[29] Some people practice the 
                Christian observances of All Hallows' Eve, including attending 
                church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead,
                although it is a secular celebration for others. 
                Some Christians historically abstained from meat on All 
                Hallows' Eve, a tradition reflected in the eating of certain 
                vegetarian foods on this vigil day, including apples, potato 
                pancakes, and soul cakes.
