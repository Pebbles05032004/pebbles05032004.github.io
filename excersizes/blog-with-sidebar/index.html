                        Cassidy, who has a unique ability to see ghosts. 
                        Cassidy's parents are paranormal investigators who have 
                        a successful TV show, but Cassidy is the only one who 
                        can actually interact with spirits. When her parents are 
                        offered the opportunity to film a new episode in
