                <p>
                    There are 4 predominant learning styles: Visual, Auditory, 
                    Read/Write, and Kinaesthetic. While most of us may have some 
                    general idea about how we learn best, often it comes as a 
                    surprise when we discover what our predominant learning 
                    style.

                <p>
                    A diagram is a drawing that shows the relationship between 
                    parts or elements of something. A chart is a graphical 
                    representation of data, usually in the form of a graph or 
                    table.

                <h3 id="mind">Mind Mapping</h3>
                <p>
                    A mind map is a diagram used to visually organize 
                    information into a hierarchy, showing relationships among 
                    pieces of the whole. It is often created around a single 
                    concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank page, 
                    to which associated representations of ideas such as images, 
                    words and parts of words are added.

                <h3 id="discussion">Discussion Based Learning</h3>
                <p>
                    Discussion-Based Learning (also called the â€œHarkness 
                    Method") is a learning style that challenges students to be 
                    responsible for their own education. Students are required 
                    to sit around an oval-discussion table and are tasked to 
                    find new information together, talk, wait for answers, and 
                    ultimately think for themselves.

                <h3 id="oral">Oral Feedback</h3>
                <p>
                    Oral feedback is the teachers' response to the students' 
                    performance in the teaching and learning process and it is 
                    importantly provided by the teachers. There are many types 
                    of oral feedback and each type has a different function.
