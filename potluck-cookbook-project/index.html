            about 8 minutes; Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a 
            paper towel-lined plate to drain, reserving about 3
            tablespoons of drippings in skillet
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>3.</b> While bacon cooks, sprinkle chicken evenly with pepper and 1/4
            teaspoon of the salt; Add chicken to skillet with bacon drippings;
            Cook over medium-high, until chicken is browned and cooked through
            (a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers
            165 degrees F (73 degreesC)), 5 to 6 minutes per side, reducing heat
            if bottom of pan gets too dark. Transfer chicken to a plate; set 
            aside until cool enough to handle, about 10 minutes. Chop chicken
            into bite-sized pieces.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>5.</b> Pour chicken broth in the mixture; cook, stirring and scraping 
            constantly to deglaze the skillet, about 1 minute. Stir in cream and
            bring to a simmer over medium heat. Simmer, stirring occasionally, 
            until slightly thickened, 3 to 5 minutes.

        <p>
            <b>6.</b> Add tortellini to boiling water, and boil until tortellini
            are tender and float to the surface, 3 to 5 minutes. Reserve 1 cup

            <li>8 ounces of uncooked elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of salted butter</li>

            <li>2 1/2 cups of milk, <i>or more as needed</i></li>
            <li>2 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of of finely grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste (<i>optional</i>)</li>

        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons of salted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 pinch of ground paprika</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>
            Directions
        </h3>
        <p>
            <b>1.</b> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (<i>175 degrees C</i>).
            Grease an 8-inch square baking dish.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>2.</b> Make the macaroni and cheese: Bring a large pot of lightly
            salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and simmmer, stirring 
            occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes; it 
            will finish cooking in the oven. Drain and transfer to the 
            prepared baking dish.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>3.</b> While the macaroni is cooking, melt 1/4 cup of butter
            in a medium skillet over low heat. Whisk in flour and stir until
            mixture becomes paste-like and light golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>4.</b> Gradually whisk 2 1/2 cups of milk into the flour mixture,
            and bring to a simmer. Stir in shredded cheddar and finely grated 
            parmesan cheese; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir over low
            heat until cheese is melted and sauce has thickened, 3 to 5 minutes,
            adding up to 1/2 cup more of milk if needed. Pour cheese sauce over
            macaroni and stir until well combined.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>5.</b> Make the bread crumb topping: Melt 2 tbs of butter in a 
            skillet over medium heat. Add bread crumbs; cook and stir until well
            coated and browned. Spread bread crumbs over macaroni and cheese,
            then sprinkle with paprika.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>6.</b> Bake in the preheated oven until topping is golden brown
            and macaroni and cheese is bubbling, about 30 minutes.
